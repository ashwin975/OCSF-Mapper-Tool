# OCSF Mapper

A Databricks-hosted Streamlit app that converts vendor security telemetry
samples into Lakewatch presets normalized to the [Open Cybersecurity Schema
Framework (OCSF)](https://ocsf.io). Generated presets are reviewed in-app,
submitted via a staging volume, and automatically opened as PRs against this
repository.

> **Status:** working internal tool. Generates production-quality presets;
> the post-merge deployment to Lakewatch is still manual.

## What it does

Today, onboarding a new security data source means manually:

1. Reading a vendor sample
2. Mapping fields to OCSF attributes
3. Writing SQL transforms for bronze → silver → gold
4. Validating against `schema.ocsf.io`
5. Iterating until correct

OCSF Mapper compresses this to:

1. Paste a sample path
2. Click Generate
3. Review and edit in-app
4. Click Submit for review
5. PR appears in this repo

The tool uses Claude (via the [`ocsf_mapper`](https://pypi.org/project/ocsf-mapper/)
library) to classify the sample, fetch the relevant OCSF schema, and generate
a complete preset using existing presets in the library as style anchors.

The split — submit-to-volume in the app, promote-to-GitHub in a separate job — means submitters don't need GitHub access. The app captures their identity from Databricks Apps OBO headers, the promoter authors commits as them, and PR attribution is preserved end-to-end without exposing a shared GitHub PAT to all users.

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for full data flow and `docs/promoter.md` for the staging/promotion details.

## Deploying

### Prerequisites

- Databricks workspace with Apps enabled
- Access to `/Volumes/dsl_dev/internal/ocsf_mapper/` (wheel + reference library)
- An Anthropic API key (entered in the app sidebar)

### Deploy from the workspace

1. Clone this repo as a Databricks Git folder (`Workspace → Create → Git folder`).
2. Navigate to `tools/ocsf-mapper/`.
3. Create a new Databricks App, point its source at this folder.
4. Click **Deploy**. Databricks reads `app.yaml`, installs `requirements.txt`, and starts the app.

### Local development

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Then enter your Anthropic API key in the sidebar.

---

## Submission flow

When a user clicks **Submit for review**, the app writes three files to the staging volume:

```
/Volumes/dsl_dev/internal/ocsf_mapper/staging/pending/<submission_id>/
├── preset.yaml          # The generated preset (post-edit)
├── report.md            # Generation report (classes, references, token counts)
└── metadata.json        # Submitter identity, OCSF version, classes, timestamp
```

Submission IDs follow the format `<UTC_timestamp>_<vendor>_<source_type>`, e.g.
`20260430T151155Z_snyk_vulnerabilities`.

The promoter (a separate Databricks notebook, not part of this app) drains
`pending/`, opens PRs against this repo, and moves the directory to
`processed/` or `failed/` based on outcome. See `docs/promoter.md` for the
notebook source and runbook.
